//An elevator pitch of your game idea***********

Do you remember Chris Pirih's classic 1991 computer game "SkiFree"? If you enjoyed running from the abominal snowman back then, you'll love this version set in the Austrian Alps.

Click the "Auf geht's!" button when you're ready to ski.
You've won when your skier makes it to the bottom of the ski slope just in time to make the train home!

---Setting the scene---

---The goal---
Ski down the slope in time to make the last train home. 

---How to play---
Use the left, right, and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate down the ski slope.

Ski down the hill in under one minute, and you win!
