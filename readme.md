# **Apr√®s-TreeSki**
 A browser based game created by Leah Livingston

Do you remember Chris Pirih's classic 1991 computer game ["SkiFree"](https://classicreload.com/win3x-skifree.html#)? If you enjoyed running from the abominal snowman back then, you'll love this version set in the Austrian Alps!

###### Let's set the scene...
[Oh je!](https://www.gymglish.com/en/wunderbla/german-vocabulary/oh-je) After skiing all morning, you spent the entire afternoon in the StuÃÅbe hut during apr√®s-ski. The last train home is in one minute, so you're cutting it close. To make the train, you'll have to take a shortcut through the trees; and let's just say, you're not in your best "state-of-mind" to ski well.üçªü•¥


###### Your goal?
Ski the shortcut through the trees to make the last train home. 


###### How to play
Click the ["Auf geht's!"](https://www.gymglish.com/en/wunderbla/german-vocabulary/auf-gehts) button and hold down the "S" key when you're ready to ski. To navigate, press the "A" key to turn left, the "D" key to turn right. Don't be afraid to test out key presses... there might be a few surprises built in for you to find!


###### How to win
You've won when your skier makes it to the bottom of the ski slope and onto the train in under one minute. If you hit three trees on the way down or don't reach the train, you lose.
