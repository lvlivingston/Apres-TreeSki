### **An elevator pitch of your game idea**

Do you remember Chris Pirih's classic 1991 computer game ["SkiFree"](https://classicreload.com/win3x-skifree.html#)? If you enjoyed running from the abominal snowman back then, you'll love this version set in the Austrian Alps!

Click the ["Auf geht's!"](https://www.gymglish.com/en/wunderbla/german-vocabulary/auf-gehts) button when you're ready to ski.
You've won when your skier makes it to the bottom of the ski slope just in time to make the train home!


###### Setting the scene
After skiing all morning, you spent the afternoon in the Stúbe hut drinking during après-ski. The last train home is in ten minutes, so you're cutting it close. It's time to ski down the hill as quickly as possible to make it back home.


###### The goal
Ski down the slope in time to make the last train home. 


###### How to play
Use the left, right, and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate down the ski slope.


###### How to win
Ski down the hill in under one minute, and you win!

This game is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Canvas.




### **Wireframes of your game**
The minimum viable product (MVP) goal is for the user interface to show basic CSS in order for a functional game to be played.
